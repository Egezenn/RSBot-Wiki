*   \[warning\] On clothes if you select _Clothes_, _Light_, _Heavy_ without the type of the item (_Head_, _Chest_ etc.) it won’t display all equipment of that type, instead it will show you the entire list.
*   \[warning\] Because the accessories don’t have a gender attribute you’ll end up with nothing if you select a gender and an accessory type.
*   \[warning\] Bot can't list stones based on their degree. Use search to get your desired stone degree with _(Lvl.x)_ x as the degree.
*   \[tip\] _Clothes_ == _Garment_ / _Robe_ || _Light_ == _Protector_ / _Light Armor_ || _Heavy_ == _Armor_ / _Heavy Armor_.
*   \[tip\] When you’re finished selecting items to sell / store I’d highly recommend you to search for all items with _Rare (SoX)_ without any other selections and tick them all with _Don’t sell_ and _Store_.
*   \[tip\] If you have a secondary weapon / shield that you use, search with the name of your weapons and untick sell / store as bot currently doesn’t have a function to mark your items as main weapon / secondary weapon / shield.
*   \[bug-iSRO\] Bot may not be able to display item names, instead it will display the items’ id. Reset the bot to fix this.

### Pickup settings

*   \[tip-vSRO\] Tick in-game _Grab function_ to _ON_, _Target grab authority_ to _Grab all items_ and _Target item_ to only _Gold_ to ensure that your pet will pick gold and only the filtered items.
