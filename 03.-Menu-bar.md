> You can use profiles to automatically select your desired account / character with the profile pargs.

> [!TIP]
> If you’re going to make a script to go to the training area, let the bot execute town script and then start recording to get to the town loop's last coordinate as a starting point to avoid any collision.

> [!TIP]
> You can cast skills, it’ll be logged into the script.

> [!TIP]
> For teleportation you need NPC’s type and teleportation option's name. Type can be found in the `Map` > `Entity list` and name is the name of the teleportation without the square brackets e.g. `Sigia Drock`.

> [!TIP]
> The town scripts are created using this. You can edit them if you feel like it.

> [!WARNING]
> Don’t go too far between 2 points. Bot won't be able to execute the movement to the specified coordinates, causing your script to fail.
