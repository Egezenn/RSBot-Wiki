# Starting off

- Download the bot from [here](https://github.com/SDClowen/RSBot/releases/latest) and extract the contents of it to a path of your choosing.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you don't have .NET Runtime, the bot will prompt you to install it on launch.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Exclude your bot's installation path from the antivirus software that you’re using if you're encountering issues.

- Once you lauch the bot, it will prompt you to locate `sro_client.exe` in your silkroad folder, after that the main bot window should open.

> [!WARNING]
> Unlike other old bots you don't have to have multiple bot folders to have multiple instances, each containing the bot software's contents. Instead there is a profile system which allows you to do the same thing.

- After the program opens you’ll need to select your client type.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You've to select `Vietnam` for most private servers, there are 3 versions for it, try other versions if one doesn't seem to work.  
> `Global` for iSRO, `Turkey` for TRSRO so on and so forth.
