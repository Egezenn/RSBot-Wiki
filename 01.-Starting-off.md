1.  Download the bot from [here](https://github.com/SDClowen/RSBot/releases/tag/v2.0-official) and remember to **exclude** your bots’ installation path from the antivirus software that you’re using.
2.  After installation a pop-up window will show, if you don't have .NET 6 **Desktop** runtime x64/x86 there is a link for it in that pop-up to install it. Alternatively if you try to launch the bot without the runtime, it'll redirect you to the site.
3.  Once you lauch the bot, it will require you to locate **sro\_client.exe** in your silkroad folder, after that the program should open.
4.  After the program opens you’ll need to select your client type. Global for iSRO, Vietnam for vSRO (this also includes **MOST** private servers \[bot has 3 options for Vietnam, so try others if one doesn’t seem to work.\]), Turkey for TRSRO etc. You can also relocate the sro\_client.exe with the button containing 3 dots.
