### Area

Lets you select a training area and characters’ behavior.

*   \[warning\] I recommend that you specify an area that isn’t on a trade route or isn't a populated area. Bot will try to target NPC thieves and possibly trade pets which will stutter the bot or bot might PK people randomly.
*   \[bug-vSRO\] Walk around option might fail movement scripts which will cause bot to stutter. I recommend to turn this on if you don’t get any error logs like _movement script failed!_.

### Avoidance

Lets you avoid & prefer certain type of mobs.

### Back to training

Lets you determine which script to use to the training area and the behavior while executing that script.

*   \[warning\] _Cast buffs_ will use _Buffing skills_ on _Training_.
*   \[warning\] _Use Reverse_ will use the last death point.
*   \[tip\] If you’re searching for the auto-usage of speed drugs, the _Use speed drug_ will do it. (Only works while botting though and might not work all the time)
*   \[bug-vSRO\] It might try to use buffs when you’re in the storage causing bot to get stuck. This will occur in Samarkand.

### Berserk

Lets you determine when to use berserk.
