### Player skills

Will list your skills and let you add them into _Attacking skills_ & _Buffing skills_ with right click.

*   \[tip\] Use the bottom ticks to filter through your skills while configuring your training skills.
*   \[bug\] Sometimes bot will auto-attack.
*   \[bug\] Bot may be not be able to display skills. To fix this you have to restart the bot. You'll still be able to add skills by dumb luck though.
*   \[bug-vSRO\] Bot might try to use _Malicious Devil Skill_ even if it’s in cooldown after death, this might stutter the bot a little and spam logs but the bot will still work, and it’ll activate the devil when it’s available. You might also get the same behavior on certain skills like _Snow_ and _Bless_ if they have disabled teleport skill reset. If it’s preventing the bot from working, just don’t use them yet.
*   \[bug-iSRO\] Bot may not be able to display skill names, instead it will display the skills’ id. Reset the bot to fix this.

### General setup

Will list the skills you’ve selected to train, buttons that can order the list or remove a skill and some behavior

*   \[warning\] Because the bot always attacks and if your mana pool is low, your str character might not find the mana to recast things like _Holy Recovery Division_. A fix for this may be to not use too many skills that require high mana like _Healing Cycle_ as it will constantly lower your mana because of it’s low cooldown.
*   \[tip\] General types’ skills will apply to all mob types that doesn’t have skills.
*   \[tip\] If your character is str and europe, I recommend putting high mana skills to the top.
