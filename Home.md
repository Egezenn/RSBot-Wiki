### [Version 2.1 (08.08.2022)](https://github.com/SDClowen/RSBot/releases/tag/v2.0-official)

### An open-source Silkroad Online bot!

This documentation currently focuses mostly on bugs and how to avoid them & tricks that'd help you use the bot better rather than explaining every aspect of the bot as the Silkroad Online community is quite familiar with botting software. Though that part will be included in the nearest future!
